## Project Synopsis
Nutware Games is an aspiring group of web developers with the goal of providing accessible multiplayer tabletop games on a digital format. Our goal is to establish an online hub that users can rely on to enjoy some of their favorite card or board games with friends. It is often difficult, especially with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, to meet others in-person to play physical card/board games and online alternatives either may not exist or are hidden behind expensive paywalls. Nutty Arcade (http://www.nuttyarcade.com/) is our free-to-play gaming hub that allows users to play popular tabletop games - such as fish, Catan, and Monopoly -, save their in-game progress and achievements, customize their profiles, and connect with friends at minimal to no cost to the player.
